# 02. Application deployment

Follow these few steps to install the Bookinfo use application on your kubernetes cluster.

## Task 1. Create a labeled/protected namespace

APIClarity will use istio to monitor application traffic.

Create a dedicated namespace for the user application.
Add an istio-injection label so that istio automatically inserts envoy proxy to the user application.

```bash
kubectl create namespace bookinfo
kubectl label namespace bookinfo istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
```

## Task 2. Deploy Bookinfo application

The Bookinfo application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The Bookinfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

* productpage. The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.
* details. The details microservice contains book information.
* reviews. The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.
* ratings. The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 doesnâ€™t call the ratings service.
* Version v2 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
* Version v3 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

The end-to-end architecture of the application is shown below.

As the application architecture is based on micro-services which use REST APIs for inter communication,
APIClarity can analyse it.

Run the following command to install the BookInfo application:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.15/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml --namespace=bookinfo
```

You should have a similar output:

```console
service/details created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v1 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created
service/productpage created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
```

## Task 3. Generate traffic

[Locust](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/#) is deployed next to simulate periodic user requests.

Run the following command:

```bash
cat > locust.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: reviews-inject-config
data:
  locustfile.py: |
    from locust import HttpUser, task
    class HelloWorldUser(HttpUser):
        @task
        def hello_world(self):
            self.client.get("/productpage?u=normal")
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: reviews-inject-v1
  labels:
    app: reviews-inject
    version: v1
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reviews-inject
      version: v1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: reviews-inject
        version: v1
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: reviews-inject-config
      containers:
      - name: reviews-inject
        image: locustio/locust
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /bookinfo/locustfile.py
          subPath: locustfile.py
        command:
        - /bin/bash
        - -c
        - "locust -f /bookinfo/locustfile.py --headless -u 1 -r 1 --host http://productpage.bookinfo.svc.cluster.local:9080"
EOF
```

Then apply the locust configuration

```bash
kubectl apply -f locust.yaml
```
