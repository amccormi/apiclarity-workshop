# 02. Application deployment

Follow these few steps to install the Google microservices online boutique demo application on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Task 1. Label namespace for side-car injection

APIClarity will use Istio to monitor application traffic.

The boutique demo microservices run in the default namespace.
Add an Istio-injection label so that Istio automatically inserts an envoy proxy to each microservice application.

```bash
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
```

## Task 2. Deploy online boutique application

The boutique demo deploys 11 microservices to simulate an e-commerce application. More information can be found here: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo

The end-to-end architecture of the application is shown below.

As the application architecture is based on microservices which use REST APIs for inter-communication,
APIClarity can analyse it.

Run the following commands to install the Boutique demo application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
kubectl apply -f microservices-demo/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

You should have a similar output:

```console
deployment.apps/emailservice created
service/emailservice created
deployment.apps/checkoutservice created
service/checkoutservice created
deployment.apps/recommendationservice created
service/recommendationservice created
deployment.apps/frontend created
service/frontend created
service/frontend-external created
deployment.apps/paymentservice created
service/paymentservice created
deployment.apps/productcatalogservice created
service/productcatalogservice created
deployment.apps/cartservice created
service/cartservice created
deployment.apps/loadgenerator created
deployment.apps/currencyservice created
service/currencyservice created
deployment.apps/shippingservice created
service/shippingservice created
deployment.apps/redis-cart created
service/redis-cart created
deployment.apps/adservice created
service/adservice created
```

The boutique demo comes with a load generator that automatically runs in the background to simulate REST API requests to the other services.
