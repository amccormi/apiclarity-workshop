# Skeleton for creating a new demo/lab content:

- put your .md files in the root of the repo - they will be taken in alphabetical order, maybe a good idea to start with numbers, like 01..., 02....
- any images you use in your md files should be put in the images folder
- put the needed files/scripts/code for the lab inside the content folder. the contents of that folder will be copied in the home directory of the lab user
  
the current file (README.md) will be ignored on the demo platform.
